## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Running

You have two options to run the calculator:

### Option 1: Full Version (Recommended) üåü

This version includes all features, including graphing, matrices, and symbolic computation. It requires the installation of external libraries.

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
    cd YOUR_REPO
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib sympy scipy
    ```

3.  **Run the calculator:**
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

### Option 2: Light Version (No Dependencies) ü™∂

This version does not require any external libraries to be installed. It's perfect if you want a powerful scientific calculator without the advanced graphing and matrix features.

1.  **Download the code:**
    - Download the `calculator.py` file from this repository.
    - **Important:** Replace its content with the code from the "light version" provided in the project discussion.

2.  **Run the calculator:**
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```
